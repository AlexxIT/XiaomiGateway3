Control Zigbee devices from Home Assistant with **Xiaomi Gateway 3 (ZNDMWG03LM)** on original firmware.

Gateway support **Zigbee 3**, **Bluetooth Mesh** and **HomeKit**.

This method does not change the device firmware. Gateway continues to work with Mi Home and HomeKit.

Thanks to **Serrj** for [instruction](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/xiaomi-mijia-smart-multi-mode-gateway-zndmwg03lm-support/159586/61) how to enable Telnet on this device.

**Important:** This component does not work with:
 - Xiaomi Gateway 2 (DGNWG02LM, lumi.gateway.v3) - use [this](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/xiaomi_aqara/) component
 - Xiaomi Gateway EU (DGNWG05LM, lumi.gateway.mieu01)

# Supported BLE Devices

Demo video:

[![Xiaomi Rubik's Cube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4D_vqvUre_0/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D_vqvUre_0)

Tested Devices:
- Xiaomi Door Sensor 2 (MCCGQ02HL)
- Xiaomi Flower Monitor (HHCCJCY01)
- Xiaomi Rubik's Cube (XMMF01JQD) - don't sends edge info, only direction!
- Xiaomi TH Sensor (LYWSD03MMC)
- Xiaomi TH Sensor (LYWSDCGQ/01ZM)
- Xiaomi TH Watch (LYWSD02MMC)

Currently supported, but not tested, other Xiaomi BLE devices officially supported by the Gateway with these attributes:

> temperature, humidity, motion, illuminance, moisture, conductivity, formaldehyde, mosquitto, battery

BLE devices and their attributes do not appear immediately! And don't save their data across HA reboots! Their data is updated only when the device itself sends them. Temperature, humidity and battery may refresh at different times.

# Install

HOWTO video:

[![Xiaomi Gateway 3 control from Home Assistant](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CQVSFISC9CE/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVSFISC9CE)

You can install component with HACS custom repo ([example](https://github.com/AlexxIT/SonoffLAN#install-with-hacs)): `AlexxIT/XiaomiGateway3`.

Or manually copy `xiaomi_gateway3` folder from latest release to `custom_components` folder in your config folder.

# Config

With GUI. Configuration > Integration > Xiaomi Gateway 3. And enter Gateway **IP address** and **Mi Home token**.

You need [obtain Mi Home token](https://github.com/Maxmudjon/com.xiaomi-miio/blob/master/docs/obtain_token.md). I am using the [method with Mi Home v5.4.54](https://github.com/Maxmudjon/com.xiaomi-miio/blob/master/docs/obtain_token.md#non-rooted-android-phones) for non-rooted Android. If you don't have an Android - you can install the [emulator on Windows](https://www.bignox.com/).

**Attention:** The component is under active development. Breaking changes may appear.

# Advanced config

Support custom occupancy timeout for motion sensor. Default 90 seconds.

```yaml
xiaomi_gateway3:
  devices:
    '0x158d00044c5dff':
      occupancy_timeout: 90  # (optional) default 90 seconds
```

# Handle BLE Locks

Email me if the values are wrong somewhere. I translated from Chinese [documentation](https://iot.mi.com/new/doc/embedded-development/ble/object-definition).

Example of several automations:

```yaml
automation:
- alias: Doorbell
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.ble_1010274797_action
    to: door
  condition:
    condition: template
    value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.attributes['action_id'] == 3 }}"
  action:
    service: persistent_notification.create
    data_template:
      title: Doorbell
      message: The doorbell is ringing

- alias: Lock Error
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.ble_1010274797_action
    to: lock
  condition:
    condition: template
    value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.attributes['error'] }}"
  action:
    service: persistent_notification.create
    data_template:
      title: Lock ERROR
      message: "{{ trigger.to_state.attributes['error'] }}"

- alias: Open lock
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.ble_1010274797_action
    to: lock
  condition:
    condition: template
    value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.attributes['action_id'] == 0 }}"
  action:
    service: persistent_notification.create
    data_template:
      title: Lock is open
      message: |
        Opening method: {{ trigger.to_state.attributes['method'] }}
        User ID: {{ trigger.to_state.attributes['key_id'] }}
```

# How it works

The component enables **Telnet** on Gateway via [Miio protocol](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-miio). Only this Gateway supports this command. Do not try to execute it on other Xiaomi/Aqara Gateways.

The component starts the **MQTT Server** on the public port of the Gateway. All the logic in the Gateway runs on top of the built-in MQTT Server. By default, access to it is closed from the outside.

**ATTENTION:** Telnet and MQTT work without a password! Do not use this method on public networks.

After rebooting the device, all changes will be reset. The component will launch Telnet and public MQTT every time it detects that they are disabled.

# Debug mode

Component support debug mode. Shows only component logs. The link to the logs is always random.

Demo video of my other component, but the idea is the same:

[![Control Sonoff Devices with eWeLink firmware over LAN from Home Assistant](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Lt5fT4N5Pm8/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt5fT4N5Pm8)

With `debug: bluetooth` or debug `debug: mqtt` option you will get advanced log for raw BLE and MQTT data.

With `debug: true` option you will get usual component logs.

```yaml
xiaomi_gateway3:
  debug: true  # you will get HA notification with a link to the logs page
```

You can filter data in the logs and enable auto refresh (in seconds).
